<h1>When I Wake Up</h1>
<p>I wake up to the noises in the basment where my siblings live. They screatch like banshees, even if they are in the same building as them,
you get stressed out.</p>
<h1>Getting ready for school</h1>
<p> Brush teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, go to school</p>
<h1>When at school</h1>
<p>Learn, see friends, see teachers, eat lunch, and then get buried in homework.</p>
<h1>Coming home</h1>
<p>Once I'm picked up, I get taken home by my parents or my carpool's parents, depends.</p>
<h1>At home.</h1>
<p>Eat dinner, do work, and fall asleep. Then I am waken up by noise. It's another day.</p>
